Render a realistic image of this character:
Blobby Alien Character Spec Name: Glorptak (or nickname: "Glorp")
Visual Appearance Body Shape: Amorphous and gelatinous. Overall silhouette resembles a teardrop or melting marshmallow, shifting slightly over time. Can squish and elongate when emotional or startled.
Material Texture: Semi-translucent, bio-luminescent goo with a jelly-like wobble. Surface occasionally ripples when communicating or moving quickly.
Color Palette:
- Base: Iridescent lavender or seafoam green
- Accents: Subsurface glowing veins of neon pink, electric blue, or golden yellow
- Mood-based color shifts (anger = dark red, joy = bright aqua, fear = pale gray)
Facial Features:
- Eyes: 3–5 asymmetrical floating orbs inside the blob that rotate or blink independently
- Mouth: Optional—appears as a rippling crescent on the surface when speaking or emoting
- No visible nose or ears; uses vibration-sensitive receptors embedded in goo
- Limbs: None by default, but can extrude pseudopods (tentacle-like limbs) when needed for interaction or locomotion. Can manifest temporary feet or hands.
Movement & Behavior Locomotion:
- Slides, bounces, and rolls.
- Can stick to walls and ceilings via suction. When scared, may flatten and ooze away quickly.
Mannerisms:
- Constant wiggling or wobbling even at rest
- Leaves harmless glowing slime trails
